Do the same assignment as program 4 but instead of you guessing the computers number, the computer tries to guess your number. Use the provided code as a starting point.

You think of a number (between 1 - 100)

Computer takes a guess

You type "too high" or "too low" or "yes"

Based on that, the computer adjusts its guess.

(Extra Credit). Devise an algorithm that solves this in 10 or less steps

Hint: attached to this assignment there is an example program to compare two strings in MASM.
